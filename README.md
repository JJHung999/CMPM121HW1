  The Scene that I was trying to make was basically a cyberpunk meets solarpunk, mixing in elements of cyberpunk such as heavy urban buildings
and a couple neon signs as well as nature positive elements such as a bountiful amount of trees and the solar array along the windows. In this
scene I included 4 different KB3D buildings and integrated 2 KB3D Neon Signs (Neon Sign C is a set of wires and a circuit breaker to which I placed
near Neon Sign B to give the appearance that the wires are attached to the sign). I included 3 different cars that have their own move scripts to 
move across the window (in the first person view). I placed in a few different trees individually, where Main tree has a few smaller trees in order
to have some branches show up through the window. The room the character is housed in is built out of 2 long stretched out cubes that serve as the
walls, 3 altered planes that serve as 1 wall, floor, and ceiling. The window is build out of 5 cubes total, with 2 pairs sharing the same texture
in order to house the plain. The door is built out of 7 cubes, 3 dedicated for the frame, another 3 dedicated for the opening, and the main wooden
cube that serves as the main door. The Window and Door are empty parents that just house the numerous amount of transformed cubes. I have 3 
retextured pots (using a jade texture), which houses some trees. There is a gate access machine next to the door. The room is furnished with
1 fridge, 1 washaing machine, 1 chair, 1 couch, a vase with a bush, 1 minimalist table, 1 remote on top of the table, 1 TV, 4 of the same crates,
1 red gun, 1 blue gun, 1 office desk, 1 computer with a monitor set up, 2 solar panels (1 attached to the monitor and 1 attached to the sword).
a minimalist dining table, 1 NinjaFBX sword, 1 Steampunk Sword. There are 3 planes sharing the same Hologram 1 texture (but each are sized differently).
The chair has a particular framed pillow that I used to replace all the other pillows on the couch. The main inspirations for this scene was just the 
general themes of cyberpunk and solarpunk, I just wanted to see if I can bring these two themes together. Originally I wanted to make cyberpunk x 
solarpunk with the main character being the sci-fi version of the Green Knight, and create a vigilante that defended nature. However the main character
I wound up with was a woman wearing a robo-like helmet (which was originally a drone that I deconstructed and attached to her head). She would still 
maintain her weapons which include 2 guns, 1 regular sword, and 1 solar powered sword. I do still want her to take on the mantle of the sci-fi
eco-vigilante.
